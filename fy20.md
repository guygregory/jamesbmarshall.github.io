Hello! I'm James and this fiscal year I'm your technology strategist at Microsoft. Since I'll be working with a larger number of partners this year, and introducing myself many times, I figured I'd put this little intro together to answer some common questions...

You can find out more [about me](/aboutme) elsewhere on my blog, but in short I've been at Microsoft since 2010 where I started in the education team working on the forerunner to Office 365 Education and have held various roles customer and partner-facing leading up to me becoming a technology strategist three years ago. For the last two years I've worked specifically with Tech Data, Arrow ECS, intY and Wirehive on buildling world-class channel engagement and transformation programs. I'm proud that in both of those years my partners have won a Microsoft Partner of The Year award as Indirect Providers (Tech Data in 2018, Arrow ECS in 2019).

Personally, I'm father to two incredible little girls, and husband to an amazing wife. I live just outside Reading, and am primarily based at Microsoft's UK HQ in Thames Valley Park.

## What do I enjoy?
