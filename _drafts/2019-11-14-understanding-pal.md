I spend a lot of my time talking to Microsoft Partners about they best way to get recognised for the work they do with customers and how they can best earn incentives for that work. I'm absoultely terrible at remembering all the details so this blog post is as much a reference for me as it is for you! The Partner Admin Link capability is critical for Microsoft Partners who do anything with Azure.

## What is the Partner Admin Link?

Simply put, the PAL is there to make it really easy for partners to measure their influence over the Azure consumption they drive with their customers. Customers consume Azure services through a variety of means, such as PAYG through the web, purchasing on an Enterprise Agreement if they're a large organisation, or through a subscription model like the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program. PAL allows a partner to be recorgnised regardless of which model the customer chooses. It even supports mutiple partners who work on a single customer's subscription. It's all driven by adding your Microsoft Partner Network ID (MPN ID) which makes it simple to apply and manage.

## Sorting your MPN IDs out
